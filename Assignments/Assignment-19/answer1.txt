Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to perform different actions based on different conditions. These statements evaluate an expression and execute a block of code if the condition is true or false.

Types of Conditional Statements:
if statement
if...else statement
else if statement
switch statement




1. if Statement
The if statement executes a block of code if the specified condition is true.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
}


Example:
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
}
In this example, if the value of age is 18 or more, the message "You are eligible to vote." will be displayed.






2. if...else Statement
The if...else statement executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.

Syntax:

if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if the condition is false
}
Example:
let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are not eligible to vote.");
}
Here, if age is less than 18, the second message will be printed.





3. else if Statement
The else if statement can test multiple conditions. If the first condition is false, it checks the next one.

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}
Example:
let marks = 85;

if (marks >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (marks >= 80) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else if (marks >= 70) {
  console.log("Grade: C");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: D");
}
This example checks multiple conditions to determine the grade based on marks.






4. switch Statement
The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the value against multiple cases, and executes the block of code associated with the matching case.

Syntax:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression matches value2
    break;
  default:
    // code to be executed if no cases match
}
Example:

let day = 2;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}
In this example, since day is 2, the output will be "Tuesday".
